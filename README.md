# Diabetes Risk Prediction Project

## Introduction
This project aims to predict the risk of diabetes based on various health indicators and symptoms. It utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze a dataset containing information such as age, gender, symptoms, and other health metrics to predict whether an individual is likely to have diabetes.

## Installation
To run the code locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone [https://github.com/ezrarichard/diabetes-risk-prediction.git](https://github.com/ezrarichard/Diabetes-Prediction-ML.git)


2. Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage
After cloning the repository and installing the dependencies, you can run the diabetes prediction script using the following command:

python diabetes_prediction.py


This will preprocess the data, train a machine learning model, and predict the risk of diabetes based on the input features.
